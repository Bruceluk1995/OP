# Trend To Theme-Pack Router

Use after selecting a Google Trends JP seed, absurd-news seed, or social-video seed and before choosing the final title, cheat, or one-shot blueprint.

This router maps a hot seed to a male-isekai theme engine. These routes mirror `../jp-isekai-plan/references/type-packs/`, but the output remains a standalone 14,500-16,500 Japanese-character one-shot. Do not use the six-episode structure from those type packs directly; compress the selected route into 12-18 meaningful one-shot beats.

## Routing Protocol

1. Score everyday resonance, absurdity, and video-hook clarity before route selection. Prefer concrete unfairness or visible challenge over remote spectacle.
2. Extract the hot/news/video seed's reusable fantasy function: desire, fear, object, absurd rule, competition, broken service, hidden cost, challenge, proof, game exploit, disaster, tool, money pressure, social proof, or public accusation.
3. Reject direct use of real people, scandals, crime, tragedy, political rage bait, or copyrighted franchise plots.
4. Choose one primary theme route and one backup route.
5. Convert the seed into a repeatable cheat or dungeon/guild rule that fits the primary route.
6. Run the ledger check with `everyday_resonance`, `theme_route`, `trend_seed`, `cheat`, `opening_bomb`, and `payoff_engine` before drafting.

## Theme Routes

| Route | Use when the trend suggests | One-shot compression |
|---|---|---|
| `battle-leveling` | sports, tournament, rankings, physical limits, monster ecology, weather/disaster as combat pressure | weak-looking skill -> tactical monster rule -> visible kill/drop/rank result |
| `op-dominance` | growth stocks, AI, space, solar flare, national-scale risk, overwhelming systems, power ceiling fantasies | enemy misread -> restrained choice -> overwhelming reveal -> public/faction consequence |
| `exile-support-reversal` | jobs, layoffs, evaluations, money pressure, accusations, doping/scandal-shaped topics after abstraction | "useless" support function -> old party failure -> public proof -> clean zamaa |
| `academy-game-knowledge` | school, exams, games, anime-route talk, ranking tests, hidden route/flag topics | route knowledge -> changed action -> suspicious ripple -> exam/public result |
| `earth-commute` | gadgets, apps, travel, food, medicine, logistics, convenience goods, Japan-life objects | modern object/tool logic -> secrecy cost -> cross-world advantage -> witness reward |
| `tamer-familiar` | animals, pets, nature, ecology, mascot behavior, animal rescue | companion problem -> bond trigger -> evolution/skill -> public reaction |
| `dungeon-master-territory` | infrastructure, disasters, cities, bases, maps, traps, supply lines, defense systems | controlled space/resource -> trap or floor rule -> enemy misread -> territory reward |
| `secret-society-subordinates` | organizations, fandoms, group rumors, elite teams, hidden backers, sudden reputation snowballs | tiny command -> subordinate overperformance -> enemy misread -> reputation lock |
| `craft-commerce-slowlife` | prices, food, crops, crafting, shops, household goods, local economy, comfort trends | practical object payoff -> social proof -> quiet danger solved -> reward |

## Selection Bias

- Prefer `battle-leveling`, `op-dominance`, or `exile-support-reversal` for male-audience爽文 unless the seed strongly points elsewhere.
- Use `craft-commerce-slowlife` only when the trend's payoff is object/business/social proof, not when the user wants combat爽.
- If a celebrity/person name trends, do not build on that person. Extract only an abstract function such as fame, disguise, performance, voice, ranking, or public attention, then downrank the seed unless the abstraction is strong.
- If a sports name trends, route to `battle-leveling` through trajectory, timing, stamina, teamwork, ranking, or tournament mechanics.
- If a financial trend appears, route to `op-dominance` for large-scale appraisal/system power, or `exile-support-reversal` if the hook is "low-value appraiser/porter was mocked".
- If a remote science or space trend appears, downrank it unless the story hook becomes electricity bills, phone/network failure, weather discomfort, health anxiety, transportation disruption, or work/school inconvenience.
- If a trend can only produce a grand disaster title, keep searching. A clickable male-isekai one-shot usually starts from a practical unfairness, cost, mistake, or daily-life irritation.
- If an absurd news seed has a clear unfair rule or broken institution, prefer routes that punish a visible system: `exile-support-reversal`, `academy-game-knowledge`, `craft-commerce-slowlife`, or `earth-commute`.
- If a video seed has a strong game/mechanic hook, prefer `battle-leveling`, `exile-support-reversal`, or `dungeon-master-territory` over lifestyle routes.

## Example Mappings

- `成長株` -> primary `op-dominance`, backup `exile-support-reversal`; convert to `価値鑑定` that sees "future growth" in monsters, relics, and guild contracts.
- `電気代` -> primary `exile-support-reversal`, backup `craft-commerce-slowlife`; convert to a mocked `魔力節約` skill that exposes a noble city's wasteful magic contract.
- `米価` or `値上げ` -> primary `craft-commerce-slowlife`, backup `exile-support-reversal`; convert to storage/appraisal logistics that proves a porter saved the guild's food budget.
- `太陽フレア` -> downrank as low everyday resonance unless converted into electricity/network disruption; if used, route to `dungeon-master-territory` through infrastructure failure, not cosmic spectacle.
- Sports athlete trend -> primary `battle-leveling`; convert to `軌道予測` or `戦術眼` in a guild projectile trial, never a real sports recap.
- Celebrity actor trend -> usually reject direct seed; if used, abstract into disguise/performance/public attention and route to `academy-game-knowledge` or `secret-society-subordinates`.
- Doping scandal trend -> reject real scandal details; abstract to false enhancement accusation and route to `exile-support-reversal` with `状態異常鑑定` or contract-proof payoff.
